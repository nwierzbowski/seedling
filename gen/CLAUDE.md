# Generated Code - gen/

This directory contains auto-generated code and build artifacts. Manual edits should be avoided as changes may be overwritten.

## 📝 File Scope

This `CLAUDE.md` contains only details pertinent to the `gen/` level. For Tauri-related generated code, see `src-tauri/gen/`.

## Structure

- **`schemas/`**: JSON schema files for Tauri configuration and capabilities.

→ See `src-tauri/gen/CLAUDE.md` for backend-generated code details.

## Patterns

- Auto-generated on build via `tauri build`
- Schema files used for validation and IDE autocomplete
- Manual edits should be avoided as changes may be overwritten
